# Mathematical Analysis 1

These are personal notes from a Graduate Mathematical Analysis 1 course at the University of Texas at Arlington. I am an undergraduate student compiling these notes for my own learning and reference.

I do try to make sure everything I publish is correct, but I'm only a human. I'm also a silly undergrad. If I make a mistake, let me know in the issues tab above, and I can look at fixing it.

# USAGE
View the BigNote.pdf file. I write everything separately, to keep things manageable, and then compile it all together into a giant note.
