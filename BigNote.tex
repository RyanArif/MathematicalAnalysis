\section*{Preface}
In this course, two textbooks will be used as references:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mathematical Analysis} by Tom M. Apostol,
    \item \textbf{Understanding Analysis} by Stephen Abbott.
\end{itemize}

Any references to sections or exercises will be from these books unless otherwise specified.
Most of the content will be based on Abbott, but Apostol has some topics Abbott lacks.

Also, note, I'm an undergraduate student. I like to think I'm smart, but I make a lot of mistakes.

If you catch one, let me know. You can make it fun by proving me wrong, I love learning.

Also: Please note, GitHub copilot was used in this project. It's built into VSCode now, and it was used here and there for generating figures, since I don't know what I'm doing with Tikz and PGFPlots.
It did try to generate theorems and proofs, but I didn't accept those edits. My definitions, theorems, and proofs are structured the way we did them in class, or by how Abbott/Apostol/I would do them.
