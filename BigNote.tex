\section*{Preface}
In this course, two textbooks will be used as references:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mathematical Analysis} by Tom M. Apostol,
    \item \textbf{Understanding Analysis} by Stephen Abbott.
\end{itemize}

Any references to sections or exercises will be from these books unless otherwise specified.
Most of the content will be based on Abbott, but Apostol has some topics Abbott lacks.

These are mostly lectures notes \& homeworks and solutions.

Also, note, I'm an undergraduate student. I like to think I'm smart, but I make a lot of mistakes.

If you catch one, let me know. You can make it fun by proving me wrong, I love learning.

\begin{note}
    These notes were written in VSCode. Unfortunately, AI is like, built into VSCode now.

    Fortunately, the AI is very handy for making the plots and pictures you'll see in the notes.

    Sometimes, the AI makes suggestions for proofs and content. I don't accept these suggestions and edits.

    Also, these notes are a compilation of my work. I've already done the work on pen and paper, I'm just typing it up here.
